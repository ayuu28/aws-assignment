# AWS Assignment

This repository includes two AWS tasks that I have successfully implemented.

---

## 📁 Task 1: Manual VPC Setup using AWS Console

In this task, I created a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) manually through the AWS Console with the following components:

- Public and Private Subnets
- Internet Gateway and Route Tables
- NAT Gateway
- Bastion Host in the public subnet
- EC2 instance in the private subnet
- SSH access to private instance via Bastion Host
- Security Groups and Key Pair management

📄 You can view the step-by-step documentation with screenshots [here](./task1/https://github.com/ayuu28/aws-assignment/blob/main/task1/Ayushi%20AWS-TASK1(11721210005).pdf).

## 📁 Task 2: VPC Setup using Terraform

In this task, I automated the same VPC architecture using Terraform. The code defines:

- VPC, subnets, and routing
- NAT and Internet gateways
- EC2 instances and security group rules
- Key pair and provisioning logic

📂 You can find the Terraform code in the [task2](./task2) folder.
